--> **I have completed the given task and I have used some basic Android features in this I think the only you need to take a look at is given below.**


-> I have used Firebase **RealTime Database** For getting data in the application.

-> For Firebase integration I have simply followed the **Firebase documentation** that's provided by Google itself, So for integration, I just followed the written steps.

-> For getting data from Firebase I used a Model class named "ReadDataModel". The Main Use of **"ReadDataModel"** is used as a way to get or send data to the Firebase server.

-> And not any other high-complexion tech stack is used for now. and I have also made some **basic UI** as per the instructions given.
